# rayleigh

The goal of rayleigh is to generate Rayleigh isotope curves.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rayleigh from [GitHub](https://github.com/biogeochem/rayleigh) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("biogeochem/rayleigh")
```

## Example

This is a basic example where the initial δ value is -20‰ and the ε is -15‰:

```{r example}
calc_rayleigh(-20, -15)
```

The resulting `data.frame` can be plotted:

```{r plot1}
plot_rayleigh(calc_rayleigh(-20, -15))
```

Note that the `plot_rayleigh` function returns a `ggplot` object so it is easy to modify:

```{r plot2}
x <- plot_rayleigh(calc_rayleigh(-20, -15))
x + theme_bw()
```
